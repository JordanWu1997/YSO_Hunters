# **YSO Hunters**
## **I.Introduction**
- Distinguishing Galaxies and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) from a database solely containing magnitudes has been
proved to be a difficult task, since the physical composition of both types of objects are similar but with different
amount (Harvey et al. 2006). Hsieh & Lai (2013) found that YSOs can stand out from Galaxies in Multi-dimensional
Magnitude Space, and thus can be separated straightforwardly. Unfortunately, the computer memory required by
the Multi-dimensional Magnitude Space method is too much for a database with 8 photometric bands, so Hsieh & Lai
(2013) used two 5-dimensional arrays instead. Here we attempt to reduce the memory requirement by choosing the
proper magnitude range (mag1, mag2),so that mag<mag1 are (almost) certainly to be YSOs and mag>mag2 are all
Galaxies. Thus, the grid point required by the Multi-dimensional Magnitude Space will be greatly reduced. Our results
will test whether the two 5-dimensional arrays chosen in Hsieh & Lai (2013) are adequate.

## **II.Goal**
- **重現 Hsieh & Lai (2013) 之結果**
- **使用新的邊界劃分節省計算multi-dimensional Magnitude Space之記憶體**
- **將5-dimensional Magnitude Space延伸至更高維度(6,7,...)**
